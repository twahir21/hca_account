Nice question 👍 — in **Qwik** this is called **resumability and lazy-loading of components**.
By default, Qwik already isolates components into **QRLs** (serialized event handlers + component code), so the browser doesn’t load or execute everything until it’s actually needed.

But you can **further control isolation** by using patterns like:

---

## 1. Lazy loading with `inlined: false`

If you want a component to only load when it’s first used, mark it as non-inlined:

```tsx
// SearchInput.tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const SearchInput = component$(() => {
  console.log('SearchInput mounted');
  return <input placeholder="Search..." />;
});
```

Now import it lazily:

```tsx
// App.tsx
import { component$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const App = component$(() => {
  const show = useSignal(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick$={() => (show.value = !show.value)}>
        Toggle Search
      </button>

      {show.value && (
        <SearchInput />
      )}
    </div>
  );
});
```

👉 Qwik will **only load SearchInput’s code when `show.value` becomes true** (lazy mount).

---

## 2. Route-level isolation (Qwik City)

Qwik City automatically code-splits by route.
Example:

```
src/routes/
  index.tsx      // homepage
  about/index.tsx // about page
```

Each page component is isolated and only hydrated when that route is visited.

---

## 3. Conditional execution with `useVisibleTask$`

If you want a component’s **logic** to run only after it becomes visible (mounted in DOM):

```tsx
import { component$, useVisibleTask$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const HeavyComponent = component$(() => {
  useVisibleTask$(() => {
    console.log("HeavyComponent logic runs only after mount/visible");
    // put expensive setup here (e.g. fetch, chart init)
  });

  return <div>⚡ Heavy Widget</div>;
});
```

This prevents code execution until the component is on screen.

---

## 4. Lazy children via `import()`

You can also dynamic-import components:

```tsx
import { component$, $, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const App = component$(() => {
  const show = useSignal(false);

  const LazyComp = $(() => import('./LazyComp').then(m => m.LazyComp));

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick$={() => (show.value = !show.value)}>Load Lazy</button>
      {show.value && <LazyComp />}
    </>
  );
});
```

This forces **network fetch** of that component chunk only when needed.

---

✅ **Summary**

* For simple cases → `{condition && <Component />}` is enough, Qwik automatically lazy-loads.
* For heavier logic → wrap with `useVisibleTask$`.
* For full isolation → use `import()` dynamic imports or rely on route-splitting.

---

Do you want me to make you a **full Qwik example app** where:

* Page loads instantly
* A heavy chart or search box is only mounted **when user clicks a button**
* And the network chunk appears in DevTools (showing it was lazy-loaded)?
